NAME
----
dirvish-stats - program which helps determining used diskspace from hardlinked dirvish backups


SYNOPSIS
--------
*DIRVISH-STATS* [OPTIONS] '<ACTION>' '<DIR/FILE>' [DIR/FILE] ...


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*DIRVISH-STATS* is a program that
provides an easy view on how much diskspace could be freeed if you delete one particular day of your hardlinked backups.

DESIGN
------
*dirvish-stats* is created for a maximum amount of backups and used diskspace.
Thus it uses only constant amount of 'RAM' and 'DOES NOT' access the backup files itself (not even from a single backup day).
For this to achieve it uses a simple key-value storage to track inode numbers and their reference count.
It also requires you to enable the index feature in dirvish (compressed either with gzip or bzip2).

REQUIREMENTS
------------
You need to have python-gdbm installed and index generation enabled in dirvish for the particular vaults.
It is highly recommend to 'NOT use gdbm' backend but instead 'use Tokyocabinet tch' as it is about 5 times faster and resulting database files are only one third in size.

Tch is the hash based backend and the fastest supported backend in dirvish-stats.
Tcb is the b-tree based backend and a bit slower than tch but produces database files nearly half the size of tch.

ACTIONS
-------
*init*::
  Initialise db-FILE with given dirvish backup directories or index files directly.

*add*::
  Add directories to db-file.

*rm*::
  Remove directories from db-file

*stat*::
  Print statistics of given directories using db-file

*dump*::
  Dump human readable form of db-file (inode refcount)

*help*::
  Show the help message.


OPTIONS
-------
*help*::
Show summary of options.

*-v, --verbose*::
Show more output.

*-f, --dbfile (default=default.gdbm)*::
Name of database file.

*-h, --human-readable (default=False)*::
Print sizes in human readable format.


EXAMPLES
--------
*dirvish-stats -h init default_\**::
Initialises the database for all backup days in this vault matching the directory name default_\*.
Additionaly it already outputs the statistics in human readable form as it populates the database.
As you might notice the statistics get better the more directories are put into the db.
This is thought only as a hint as theoretically *only* the last directory shows the right unshared value, but in reality only the statistics of the first directory is bogus.
And the following statistics are not that far off.

*dirvish-stats -h stat default_20090202 default_20090203*::
This will display the statistics of the given two backup days in human readable form.

*dirvish-stats -v stat default_20090202 |sort -n |head -n20*::
This will print the biggest 20 changed files from this backup.

*dirvish-stats rm default_20090202 default_20090203*::
This removes the two backups from the database.

*dirvish-stats add -f data.gdbm data_20090207 data_20090208*::
This will add the two backups to the database *data.gdbm*.

*dirvish-stats dump -f data.gdbm*::
Dump the database in human readable form to stdout.
