- unittests for all backends
- should links really go into the db?
- maybe plain files only?
! sqlite backend (dropped, too slow, would need merge from sql2003)

# speedup
- benchmark batch return from parse_index:yield (return 10 or more lines as list)
X dump pythons internal bzip2/gz file objects as they are PAIN SLOW!
    they are about 10 times slower than spawning bzip2/gz directly and reading from the pipe
    note: only tested on dual and quadcore as i don't have access do single core anymore
